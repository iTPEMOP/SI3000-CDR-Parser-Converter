# SI3000 parser & converter.

This is a win32 gui-application for parsing and converting binary files (*.ama) produced by Iskratel SI3000 Call Server (CS).

## Installation 

Download static binary from [Releases](https://github.com/iTPEMOP/SI3000-CDR-Parser-Converter/releases) or build it from sources.

### Parser parameters

After first launch `params.ini` should be created. 
You can freely edit it of course, but be careful. 
You can delete it as well. Then the next time you start the program, it will be created again with the default settings and `English` interface.
